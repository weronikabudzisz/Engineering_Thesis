# Engineering_Thesis
Project made for my engineering thesis on AGH Univeristy of Technology and Science in Cracow.
The topic is "Application of geoinformatics tools in map editing for kayak tourism".
For this I created the website (with help of Mapbox GL JS) representing the kayak tour from Smardzewice to Gapinin on Pilica river.
